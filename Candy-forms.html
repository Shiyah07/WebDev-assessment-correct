      <!-- 
        The form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form
        must be put inside.
        The attributes that are required are name, id, and method.
        name gives some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.
         
        id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our
        code.
        method has two typical values: get and post. Get is used for forms that do
        not ask for personal information (search bars, etc.). Post is used for forms
        that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.).
      -->

      <form name="Candy-suggestions" id="Halloween-Candy" method="get">
        <!-- 
         This is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all required attributes.
         The required attribute is only necessary when you want to make sure the user
         has to fill in the input before submitting the form.
         The type attribute defines the type of input.
         The name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the
         input when the data gets passed to the server (requires back-end scripting,
         which is beyond the scope of this course).
         The id attribute allows us to reference the input from the label and from
         other parts of our code.
         All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the
         input using the input's id attribute.
         When an input is required, it is important to include the word required
         in the label's text.

         related to each other than the country the person is recommending).

         and provides its value to the server if the user checks that box and submits the form.
         In this case, what would be passed to the server is waterBottle=bottle.

            Select inputs are widely used, but can lead to accessibility issues.
            If you can accomplish the same thing you want to do with a different
